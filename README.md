# Sales-and-Operations-Simple-Linear-Model-In-R

Description:Linear Programming is extensively used as a quantitative method for optimization. Its origin dates back to 1937. It was developed as a technique for planning expenditures and returns in order to optimize cost. LP is useful in a wide variety of situations, while maintaining a simple framework.

Purpose: This notebook provides a template for solving optimization problems. It highlights how one can go about formulating the problem in order to use the functions within the lpsolve package to obtain a result that meets all of the given constraints
